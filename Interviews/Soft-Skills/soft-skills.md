Staying engaged with the bigger picture and finding small wins keeps me motivated over the long term.*

### **6. How do you build rapport with your team?**

I also make sure to communicate clearly with the team and stakeholders, so everyone is aligned on the progress and any challenges. Taking short breaks when needed and practicing mindfulness also helps me manage stress and stay focused during intense periods.*

### **9. How do you approach decision-making when faced with multiple options?**
   - **Answer**:  
     *When faced with multiple options, I start by gathering as much information as possible about each option, including potential risks, benefits, and long-term implications. I involve relevant stakeholders and team members to get their input and perspective. I also consider how each option aligns with the project’s goals and technical constraints. If necessary, I’ll conduct a proof of concept or run tests to evaluate the effectiveness of different solutions. Ultimately, I make decisions based on data and team consensus, while also considering the bigger picture.*

### **10. How do you balance technical excellence with business needs?**
   - **Answer**:  
     *Balancing technical excellence with business needs requires understanding the broader context of the project. While I always strive for clean, maintainable, and scalable code, I recognize that business priorities sometimes require trade-offs. I work closely with product and business stakeholders to align on priorities and ensure that we meet critical deadlines. At the same time, I advocate for technical debt management and scalability to avoid long-term risks. This way, I can deliver solutions that meet both immediate business needs and long-term sustainability.*
