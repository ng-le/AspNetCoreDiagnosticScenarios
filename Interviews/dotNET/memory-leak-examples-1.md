A memory leak in .NET Core occurs when memory that is no longer needed by the application is not released, leading to increased memory usage and eventually the application running out of memory. Despite .NET Core's garbage collection mechanism, memory leaks can still occur due to several reasons, such as event handlers, static references, improper use of async/await, or unmanaged resources not being disposed of correctly.

Here are examples and solutions for common causes of memory leaks in .NET Core:

---

### 1. **Event Handlers Not Unsubscribed**

**Problem:**
When you subscribe to an event but forget to unsubscribe, the object that subscribed to the event is not eligible for garbage collection. This leads to memory leaks because the event handler holds a reference to the object.

```csharp
public class Publisher
{
    public event EventHandler MyEvent;
    
    public void RaiseEvent()
    {
        MyEvent?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);
    }
}

public class Subscriber
{
    private Publisher _publisher;

    public Subscriber(Publisher publisher)
    {
        _publisher = publisher;
        _publisher.MyEvent += HandleEvent;
    }

    private void HandleEvent(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Event received.");
    }

    ~Subscriber()
    {
        // Destructor, which won't be called if the object is not garbage collected
        Console.WriteLine("Subscriber finalized.");
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Unsubscribe from the event when the object is no longer needed.

```csharp
public class Subscriber
{
    private Publisher _publisher;

    public Subscriber(Publisher publisher)
    {
        _publisher = publisher;
        _publisher.MyEvent += HandleEvent;
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _publisher.MyEvent -= HandleEvent; // Unsubscribing to prevent memory leaks
    }

    private void HandleEvent(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Event received.");
    }
}
```

### 2. **Static Fields Holding References**

**Problem:**
Static fields persist for the lifetime of the application. If they hold references to objects, those objects will not be garbage collected, causing memory leaks.

```csharp
public class StaticMemoryLeak
{
    public static List<string> _cache = new List<string>();

    public void AddToCache(string data)
    {
        _cache.Add(data); // The list is static, so it holds onto the data indefinitely
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Ensure static fields are cleared when no longer needed, or avoid static fields unless necessary.

```csharp
public class StaticMemoryLeakFixed
{
    public static List<string> _cache = new List<string>();

    public void AddToCache(string data)
    {
        _cache.Add(data);
    }

    public void ClearCache()
    {
        _cache.Clear(); // Clear the cache when no longer needed
    }
}
```

---

### 3. **Improper Use of Async/Await**

**Problem:**
Memory leaks can occur when long-running tasks are not properly awaited or if the `Task` references are held unnecessarily. This can hold objects in memory longer than needed.

```csharp
public async Task LongRunningOperation()
{
    await Task.Delay(10000); // Simulate long operation
}

public void FireAndForget()
{
    LongRunningOperation(); // Forgetting to await causes a potential memory leak
}
```

**Solution:**
Always await the `Task` or use proper asynchronous patterns to avoid memory issues.

```csharp
public async Task LongRunningOperation()
{
    await Task.Delay(10000);
}

public async Task FireAndForgetAsync()
{
    await LongRunningOperation(); // Awaiting ensures the task is properly awaited
}
```

### 4. **Unmanaged Resources Not Disposed**

**Problem:**
.NET Core has a garbage collector for managed resources, but unmanaged resources like file handles, network sockets, or database connections need to be manually released by calling `Dispose`.

```csharp
public class FileManager
{
    private FileStream _fileStream;

    public FileManager(string filePath)
    {
        _fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open);
    }

    public void WriteData(byte[] data)
    {
        _fileStream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Implement the `IDisposable` interface and use the `Dispose` method to clean up unmanaged resources.

```csharp
public class FileManager : IDisposable
{
    private FileStream _fileStream;

    public FileManager(string filePath)
    {
        _fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open);
    }

    public void WriteData(byte[] data)
    {
        _fileStream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _fileStream?.Dispose(); // Dispose of unmanaged resources
    }
}
```

**Best Practice:**
Use the `using` statement to ensure resources are properly disposed.

```csharp
using (var manager = new FileManager("file.txt"))
{
    manager.WriteData(new byte[] { 0x1, 0x2 });
} // FileStream will be disposed automatically
```

### 5. **Large Object Heap Fragmentation**

**Problem:**
Objects larger than 85,000 bytes are allocated on the Large Object Heap (LOH). If the LOH becomes fragmented and the garbage collector cannot compact it, the memory usage grows over time.

```csharp
public class LargeObjectAllocation
{
    public void CreateLargeArray()
    {
        var largeArray = new byte[100000]; // Large object goes to LOH
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
- Minimize allocations to the LOH by reusing large objects where possible.
- Consider object pooling using `ArrayPool<T>` to reuse memory.

```csharp
public class LargeObjectAllocationFixed
{
    private ArrayPool<byte> _arrayPool = ArrayPool<byte>.Shared;

    public void CreateLargeArray()
    {
        byte[] largeArray = _arrayPool.Rent(100000); // Reuse large arrays from the pool
        try
        {
            // Use the array...
        }
        finally
        {
            _arrayPool.Return(largeArray); // Return the array to the pool to avoid memory leaks
        }
    }
}
```

### 6. **Using Finalizers Inefficiently**

**Problem:**
Finalizers can prevent objects from being collected promptly. They place objects in a separate queue, meaning memory isn't reclaimed until the finalizer runs.

```csharp
public class FinalizerExample
{
    ~FinalizerExample()
    {
        // Finalizer logic here
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
- Avoid using finalizers unless necessary.
- If you need finalizers, make sure they are fast and efficient.
- Prefer `IDisposable` over finalizers for managed and unmanaged resource cleanup.

### 7. **Leaking Contexts in ASP.NET Core**

**Problem:**
ASP.NET Core can cause memory leaks if dependencies are not properly scoped. For instance, singleton services might hold onto resources across requests, leading to memory retention.

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly HttpContext _context;

    public MyService(IHttpContextAccessor accessor)
    {
        _context = accessor.HttpContext; // Singleton might hold reference to a request-scoped object
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Ensure that services are registered with the appropriate lifetime (`Transient`, `Scoped`, or `Singleton`) and avoid holding onto context-sensitive objects in singleton services.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHttpContextAccessor();
    services.AddScoped<MyService>(); // Properly scoped service
}
```

### 8. **Memory Profiling and Debugging Tools**

To detect and fix memory leaks, use memory profiling tools like:

- **dotnet-counters**: Useful for monitoring .NET Core applications in real-time.
- **dotMemory**: A powerful memory profiler to track memory usage, object allocations, and leaks.
- **dotnet-dump**: To collect and analyze dumps of .NET Core applications.
- **Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools**: Provides memory and performance analysis features.

**Steps to Analyze Memory Leaks:**
1. Take memory snapshots at different points.
2. Analyze object retention graphs to find what is holding references.
3. Check for large object allocations and event subscriptions.

By following the best practices for disposing of unmanaged resources, managing events, using async/await, and reducing the allocation of large objects, you can prevent and solve memory leaks in .NET Core applications. Profiling tools are essential to identifying and addressing leaks in production environments.
