Certainly! Here are **more advanced cases** of memory leaks in .NET Core applications along with **detailed solutions**:

### 17. **Memory Leaks Due to Lazy Initialization**

**Problem:**
`Lazy<T>` is used to delay the initialization of objects until they are actually needed. However, if used in long-lived objects or static classes, it can lead to memory leaks if the referenced object is large or not cleared properly.

```csharp
public class LazyInitializationExample
{
    private Lazy<LargeObject> _lazyObject = new Lazy<LargeObject>(() => new LargeObject());

    public LargeObject GetObject()
    {
        return _lazyObject.Value; // The object stays in memory once initialized
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Use `Lazy<T>` carefully, particularly in static classes or services with long lifetimes. If you no longer need the lazy-loaded object, ensure that references to it are cleared, or use weak references.

```csharp
public class LazyInitializationExample
{
    private Lazy<LargeObject> _lazyObject = new Lazy<LargeObject>(() => new LargeObject());

    public LargeObject GetObject()
    {
        return _lazyObject.Value;
    }

    public void ResetLazyObject()
    {
        _lazyObject = null; // Clear reference to allow garbage collection
    }
}
```

Additionally, use `Lazy<T>` only when you are sure that the object is not going to stay in memory longer than necessary.

### 18. **Large Retained Objects in ASP.NET Core Middleware**

**Problem:**
Middleware components in ASP.NET Core can retain large objects or services for the entire lifetime of the application, leading to memory leaks if those objects are not properly scoped or disposed of.

```csharp
public class MyMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly LargeService _largeService; // Large object retained for the lifetime of the middleware

    public MyMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, LargeService largeService)
    {
        _next = next;
        _largeService = largeService; // Keeps reference to large object across requests
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Middleware logic here
        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Use scoped services in middleware to ensure that large objects are disposed of properly. Alternatively, avoid storing large objects or services directly in middleware.

```csharp
public class MyMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;

    public MyMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _next = next;
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider; // Use service provider to get scoped services
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        using (var scope = _serviceProvider.CreateScope())
        {
            var largeService = scope.ServiceProvider.GetService<LargeService>();
            // Use scoped largeService here...
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

### 19. **Memory Leaks in Object Graphs (Complex Object Structures)**

**Problem:**
Complex object graphs with deep nested references may inadvertently cause memory leaks. If one part of the graph is not released properly, the entire graph can stay in memory even though it is no longer needed.

```csharp
public class Node
{
    public Node Parent { get; set; }
    public Node Child { get; set; }
}

public class ComplexObjectGraph
{
    public Node Root { get; set; }

    public void CreateGraph()
    {
        Root = new Node();
        Root.Child = new Node { Parent = Root };
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Ensure that object graphs are correctly disconnected when no longer needed. Set references to `null` or use weak references where appropriate.

```csharp
public class ComplexObjectGraph
{
    public Node Root { get; set; }

    public void ClearGraph()
    {
        // Break the references to allow garbage collection
        Root.Child = null;
        Root = null;
    }
}
```

In case of large or complex graphs, always monitor how references are being handled to avoid unnecessary memory retention.

### 20. **Static Events Causing Memory Leaks**

**Problem:**
Static events can cause memory leaks if you do not explicitly unsubscribe from them. Static members live for the lifetime of the application, and if an event is not unsubscribed, it holds a reference to the subscribing object.

```csharp
public static class EventPublisher
{
    public static event EventHandler SomethingHappened;

    public static void RaiseEvent()
    {
        SomethingHappened?.Invoke(null, EventArgs.Empty);
    }
}

public class Subscriber
{
    public Subscriber()
    {
        EventPublisher.SomethingHappened += OnSomethingHappened; // This subscription causes a memory leak
    }

    private void OnSomethingHappened(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Handle event
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Unsubscribe from static events when the subscriber is no longer needed. Use weak references or `WeakEventManager` to prevent memory leaks.

```csharp
public class Subscriber : IDisposable
{
    public Subscriber()
    {
        EventPublisher.SomethingHappened += OnSomethingHappened;
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        EventPublisher.SomethingHappened -= OnSomethingHappened; // Unsubscribe to avoid memory leak
    }

    private void OnSomethingHappened(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Handle event
    }
}
```

Alternatively, use the `WeakEventManager` to manage event subscriptions:

```csharp
public class Subscriber
{
    public Subscriber()
    {
        WeakEventManager<EventPublisher, EventArgs>.AddHandler(null, nameof(EventPublisher.SomethingHappened), OnSomethingHappened);
    }

    private void OnSomethingHappened(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Handle event
    }
}
```

### 21. **Memory Leaks Due to Improper Use of Task.Run**

**Problem:**
Using `Task.Run` without proper cancellation can lead to tasks continuing to execute even when they are no longer required, resulting in memory leaks.

```csharp
public class TaskExample
{
    public void ExecuteLongTask()
    {
        Task.Run(() =>
        {
            // Long-running operation that may cause a memory leak if not properly canceled
            Thread.Sleep(10000); // Simulating long operation
        });
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Use `CancellationToken` to cancel long-running tasks when they are no longer needed.

```csharp
public class TaskExample
{
    private CancellationTokenSource _cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();

    public void ExecuteLongTask()
    {
        Task.Run(() =>
        {
            try
            {
                // Long-running operation that can be canceled
                Thread.Sleep(10000);
            }
            catch (OperationCanceledException)
            {
                // Task was canceled
            }
        }, _cancellationTokenSource.Token);
    }

    public void CancelTask()
    {
        _cancellationTokenSource.Cancel(); // Cancel the task to prevent memory leak
    }
}
```

### 22. **Memory Leaks in Timers**

**Problem:**
`System.Timers.Timer` or `System.Threading.Timer` can lead to memory leaks if not properly disposed. A timer keeps its callback alive even if the object is no longer needed.

```csharp
public class TimerExample
{
    private Timer _timer;

    public TimerExample()
    {
        _timer = new Timer(Callback, null, 0, 1000);
    }

    private void Callback(object state)
    {
        // Timer callback logic
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Dispose of timers when they are no longer needed to ensure they do not retain objects unnecessarily.

```csharp
public class TimerExample : IDisposable
{
    private Timer _timer;

    public TimerExample()
    {
        _timer = new Timer(Callback, null, 0, 1000);
    }

    private void Callback(object state)
    {
        // Timer callback logic
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _timer?.Dispose(); // Dispose timer to prevent memory leak
    }
}
```

Alternatively, use `System.Threading.Timer` in a scoped manner, ensuring that it is disposed of as part of the application lifecycle.

### 23. **Improper Use of `IEnumerable` Leading to Memory Leaks**

**Problem:**
Enumerating over large `IEnumerable` collections without materializing them can lead to memory leaks, as the iterator keeps a reference to the original collection.

```csharp
public class EnumerableLeak
{
    public IEnumerable<int> GetLargeCollection()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
        {
            yield return i; // The enumerator holds onto the entire collection
        }
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Materialize the `IEnumerable` by converting it to a collection like `List<T>` or `Array`. This releases the iterator and frees up memory.

```csharp
public class EnumerableLeakFixed
{
    public List<int> GetLargeCollection()
    {
        return Enumerable.Range(0, 1000000).ToList(); // Materialize the collection
    }
}
```

This way, the large collection is held in memory as a concrete type (e.g., `List`) rather than being maintained through the iterator, which can cause retention issues.

### Conclusion:

Memory leaks in .NET Core can stem from various causes, ranging from misuse of timers, lazy initialization, circular references, or improper use of services in dependency injection. The key to preventing memory leaks is understanding how resources are managed, properly disposing of
