Certainly! Here are **more examples** of common causes of memory leaks in .NET Core applications along with **solutions** to fix them:

---

### 9. **Circular References in Objects**

**Problem:**
When two or more objects hold references to each other, the garbage collector may not be able to release them, even though they are no longer in use.

```csharp
public class A
{
    public B b;
}

public class B
{
    public A a;
}
```

In this scenario, objects `A` and `B` are referencing each other. Even if no other code references them, they won’t be garbage collected, causing a memory leak.

**Solution:**
- Break circular references by using `WeakReference` or by explicitly setting one of the references to `null`.
- Use `IDisposable` where appropriate to manually release object references.

```csharp
public class A : IDisposable
{
    public B b;

    public void Dispose()
    {
        b = null; // Break the circular reference
    }
}

public class B
{
    public A a;
}
```

Alternatively, using a `WeakReference` in one direction helps prevent the strong reference chain:

```csharp
public class A
{
    public WeakReference<B> b; // Weak reference avoids strong circular dependency
}
```

### 10. **Long-Lived Collections**

**Problem:**
If you have collections that are used throughout the lifetime of your application (e.g., static collections or shared lists), they may grow indefinitely, leading to a memory leak if not managed properly.

```csharp
public class UserService
{
    private static List<User> _users = new List<User>();

    public void AddUser(User user)
    {
        _users.Add(user); // Users are never removed, leading to memory growth
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
- Regularly remove old or unused objects from long-lived collections.
- Consider using a `ConcurrentDictionary` or `HashSet` to avoid duplicates and to remove unnecessary objects efficiently.

```csharp
public class UserService
{
    private static HashSet<User> _users = new HashSet<User>();

    public void AddUser(User user)
    {
        _users.Add(user);
    }

    public void RemoveUser(User user)
    {
        _users.Remove(user); // Actively manage the collection by removing unused objects
    }
}
```

**Best Practice:** Limit the lifespan of objects in collections by purging old or inactive entries periodically.

### 11. **Incorrect Use of Dependency Injection (DI)**

**Problem:**
Memory leaks can occur if a service registered with a longer lifetime (e.g., `Singleton`) holds a reference to a service registered with a shorter lifetime (e.g., `Scoped` or `Transient`). The singleton service will keep the scoped or transient service alive for the duration of the application, causing a memory leak.

```csharp
public class SingletonService
{
    private readonly ScopedService _scopedService;

    public SingletonService(ScopedService scopedService)
    {
        _scopedService = scopedService;
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure that services with shorter lifetimes are not injected into services with longer lifetimes.
- Use `IServiceScopeFactory` to resolve shorter-lived services within a singleton or manually create a scope.

```csharp
public class SingletonService
{
    private readonly IServiceScopeFactory _serviceScopeFactory;

    public SingletonService(IServiceScopeFactory serviceScopeFactory)
    {
        _serviceScopeFactory = serviceScopeFactory;
    }

    public void PerformAction()
    {
        using (var scope = _serviceScopeFactory.CreateScope())
        {
            var scopedService = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ScopedService>();
            scopedService.DoWork();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 12. **Closure Over Local Variables in Async Methods**

**Problem:**
Closures that capture local variables can lead to memory leaks. The closure keeps the variable alive as long as the closure is referenced, even if it is no longer needed.

```csharp
public async Task ProcessDataAsync()
{
    List<int> data = GetData();
    await Task.Run(() => 
    {
        // This closure holds a reference to "data" even after the task completes
        Process(data);
    });
}
```

**Solution:**
Ensure that closures only capture what they need, or use parameters instead of capturing local variables.

```csharp
public async Task ProcessDataAsync()
{
    List<int> data = GetData();
    await Task.Run(() => 
    {
        ProcessData(data); // Avoiding closure over local variable "data"
    });
}

private void ProcessData(List<int> data)
{
    // Process data here
}
```

---

### 13. **Using Large Strings Incorrectly**

**Problem:**
Strings are immutable in .NET, meaning that modifying a string creates a new instance in memory. If you concatenate strings in a loop or frequently perform large string operations, you can end up with many large, unused string objects in memory.

```csharp
public class StringMemoryLeak
{
    public string ProcessStrings(string[] inputs)
    {
        string result = "";
        foreach (var input in inputs)
        {
            result += input; // Creates a new string object on each iteration
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
Use a `StringBuilder` for concatenating large or frequently modified strings to avoid unnecessary memory allocations.

```csharp
public class StringMemoryLeakFixed
{
    public string ProcessStrings(string[] inputs)
    {
        var sb = new StringBuilder();
        foreach (var input in inputs)
        {
            sb.Append(input); // Efficiently appends strings without creating new objects
        }
        return sb.ToString();
    }
}
```

### 14. **Unclosed Streams and Database Connections**

**Problem:**
Leaving `Stream` or `SqlConnection` objects open can lead to memory leaks because these objects consume unmanaged resources. Even though the garbage collector eventually frees them, it may take a while, leading to resource exhaustion.

```csharp
public void ReadFile(string filePath)
{
    FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open);
    // FileStream is not closed, leading to resource leak
}
```

**Solution:**
- Always close `Stream` and `IDisposable` objects when finished with them.
- Use `using` statements to ensure the objects are disposed of even if an exception occurs.

```csharp
public void ReadFile(string filePath)
{
    using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open))
    {
        // FileStream will be closed and disposed automatically
    }
}
```

---

### 15. **Memory Leaks in Caching**

**Problem:**
Caching mechanisms like `MemoryCache` can hold objects in memory indefinitely if you don’t set proper expiration policies.

```csharp
public class CacheService
{
    private MemoryCache _cache = new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions());

    public void CacheData(string key, object data)
    {
        _cache.Set(key, data); // Data remains in memory forever if not removed
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
- Use expiration policies (absolute or sliding expiration) when adding items to a cache.
- Remove unused or old cache items periodically.

```csharp
public class CacheService
{
    private MemoryCache _cache = new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions());

    public void CacheData(string key, object data)
    {
        var cacheOptions = new MemoryCacheEntryOptions
        {
            AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5) // Expire after 5 minutes
        };
        _cache.Set(key, data, cacheOptions); // Cached item will expire after the set time
    }
}
```

### 16. **Thread Local Storage Memory Leaks**

**Problem:**
Using `ThreadLocal<T>` objects can cause memory leaks if not disposed of correctly because they keep data in memory per thread, which might not be collected until the thread is finished.

```csharp
public class ThreadLocalExample
{
    private ThreadLocal<int> _threadLocalValue = new ThreadLocal<int>(() => 0);

    public int Value => _threadLocalValue.Value;
}
```

**Solution:**
- Dispose `ThreadLocal<T>` objects when they are no longer needed.

```csharp
public class ThreadLocalExample : IDisposable
{
    private ThreadLocal<int> _threadLocalValue = new ThreadLocal<int>(() => 0);

    public int Value => _threadLocalValue.Value;

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _threadLocalValue.Dispose(); // Properly dispose to prevent memory leaks
    }
}
```

By adhering to best practices in resource management, dependency injection, string handling, and caching, you can avoid many common causes of memory leaks in .NET Core applications. Regular memory profiling is also crucial to detect and address issues early in the development cycle.
